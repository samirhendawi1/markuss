# Your Task

Your task is to complete the code so that you can successfully run the main method.

Please refer to the provided python code in `adts_homework.py` as you work on implementing
the logic of the Binary Search Tree class. The `BST.contains` method and some
of the basic structure has also been provided to help you get started.

**See the TODOs in the files for where you need to write code.**

The output of the `Main.main` method should look similar to below (exact timing will of course vary):

```
  500    class BSTMultiSet 4.50e-04s
 1000    class BSTMultiSet 2.14e-04s
 2000    class BSTMultiSet 4.19e-04s
 4000    class BSTMultiSet 7.69e-04s
 8000    class BSTMultiSet 2.19e-03s
16000    class BSTMultiSet 7.79e-03s
```

You should find that the python code maps onto Java without too much trouble, but
please ask if you get stuck on any of the syntax.

This is very similar to the lab activity this week, but it has been
reduced in terms of scope to have you code one data structure to implement the `MultiSet` ADT.

Reminder: you may need to manually mark `src` as the Sources Root in order to run the code.

# How to Submit

Push your completed `src/BST.java` and `src/BSTMultiSet` files to MarkUs.

Run the self tests on MarkUs to ensure your code can be graded.

Reminder that you can use up to 72 hours of grace tokens on each assignment.

Note 1: make sure to push your code to the `master` branch on MarkUs, as that is the
version which will be graded and what you will see in the Submissions tab on MarkUs.
Feel free to use branches as you work for practice, but make sure to locally merge your branch into `master`

Note 2: self-tests are provided, but we will also run some additional hidden tests on `BST.java`,
so make sure to double-check that the logic of those methods is fully correct in your implementation.

Note 3: the self-tests for `BST.java` are also provided in the starter code so that you can also run that
subset of the self-tests from MarkUs locally.
You can run the tests in `BSTSelfTest.java` the same way as described in the test file from lab this week.

Note 4: you may need to manually mark `test` as the Test Sources Root in order to run the code.

**If you have any questions, please don't hesitate to ask on piazza.**
