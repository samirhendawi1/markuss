    //            method. As with the python version, this shouldn't require a lot of code to write.

    //                  but make sure to double-check that you are calling the correct methods!

    //                  the sources root; if it still isn't there, you will just need to manually
    //                  copy over the method headers from MultiSet.java to be implemented.
